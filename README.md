# Symu

Symu is a C# opensource framework for organization simulation. 
You can develop your own application to run virtual experiments with organizations and capture their dynamic behaviors, their evolutions.<br>
Symu targets agnostic organizations as social groups and does not plan to implement functionality for specific types of organizations.<br>

## How it works

Symu models groups and organizations as complex systems and captures the variability in human, technological and organizational factors through heterogeneity in information processing capabilities, knowledge and resources.<br>
The non-linearity of the model generates complex temporal behavior due to dynamic relationships among agents.

## What it is

Symu, is a multi-agent system, time based with discrete events, for the co-evolution of agents and socio-cultural environments.
Agents are decision-making units and can represent various levels of analysis such as individuals, groups or organizations.<br>
Agents are autonomous, rationally bounded and tasks based.<br>
They interact simultaneously in a shared environment that interacts in turn with the agents, via asynchronous messages.

## Why open source

Because we believe that such a framework is valuable for organizations and academics.

### Academic program

Symu is based on a library of theoretical models:
organization theory, social networks, socio-cultural environment, information diffusion, socio-technical environmentâ€¦

With our academic program, we will first implement models that you want to use for you.

## Getting Started
The main project is [SymuEngine](https://github.com/lmorisse/Symu/tree/master/Symu%20source%20code/SymuEngine). This is the framework you'll use to build your own application in batch or GUI mode.

The sample projects are interesting to understand what the framework can do. They are divided into models, for example [learning and forgetting models](https://github.com/lmorisse/Symu/tree/master/Symu%20examples/SymuLearnAndForget). They allow you to discover, understand and configure each model, in this sense it is a good entry point.
