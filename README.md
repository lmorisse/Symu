# Symu

Symu is a C# opensource framework for organization simulation. 
You can develop your own application to run virtual experiments with organizations and capture their dynamic behaviors, their evolutions.<br>
Symu targets agnostic organizations as social groups and does not plan to implement functionality for specific types of organizations.<br>
[Website : http://symu.org/](http://symu.org/)

## How it works

Symu models groups and organizations as complex systems and captures the variability in human, technological and organizational factors through heterogeneity in information processing capabilities, knowledge and resources.<br>
The non-linearity of the model generates complex temporal behavior due to dynamic relationships among agents.

## What it is

Symu, is a multi-agent system, time based with discrete events, for the co-evolution of agents and socio-cultural environments.
Agents are decision-making units and can represent various levels of analysis such as individuals, groups or organizations.<br>
Agents are autonomous, rationally bounded and tasks based.<br>
They interact simultaneously in a shared environment that interacts in turn with the agents, via asynchronous messages.

## Why open source

Because we believe that such a framework is valuable for organizations and academics. And that academics can enrich use cases and models implemented in this framework.
