Welcome to Symu's documentation
*******************************

Symu is a C# opensource framework for **organization simulation**. 
You can develop your own application to run virtual experiments with organizations and capture their dynamic behaviors, their evolutions.

Organization simulation
=======================

Symu models groups and organizations as complex systems. It captures the variability in human, technological and organizational factors through heterogeneity in information processing capabilities, but also in knowledge and resources. Also, the non-linearity of the model generates complex temporal behavior due to dynamic relationships among agents.

Symu implements agnostic organizations as social groups to target the most general use cases.

How it works
============

Symu models groups and organizations as complex systems and captures the variability in human, technological and organizational factors through heterogeneity in information processing capabilities, knowledge and resources.<br>
The non-linearity of the model generates complex temporal behavior due to dynamic relationships among agents.

What it is
==========

Symu, is a multi-agent system, time based with discrete events, for the co-evolution of agents and socio-cultural environments.
Agents are decision-making units and can represent various levels of analysis such as individuals, groups or organizations.<br>
Agents are autonomous, rationally bounded and tasks based.<br>
They interact simultaneously in a shared environment that interacts in turn with the agents, via asynchronous messages.
